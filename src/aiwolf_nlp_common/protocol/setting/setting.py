"""Defines GameSetting class for werewolf game configuration management.

The GameSetting class encapsulates various parameters and rules for the game, as received from a
game server. It includes information such as:
- Role distribution
- Limits on talking and whispering
- Voting and attack rules
- Time limits for actions and responses
- Special game modes (e.g., no attack, visible votes)

The class provides methods for initializing these settings either directly or from a JSON object
received from the game server.

Classes:
    GameSetting: Represents the complete set of game settings.

Imports:
    .map.role_num_map.RoleNumMap: Imported to handle role distribution information.

Note:
    This module is designed to work with a specific game server protocol. Ensure that the
    server's JSON format matches the expected structure in the initialize_from_json method.
