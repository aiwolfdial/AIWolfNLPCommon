"""This module defines the actions that an agent can perform in the AIWolfNLP game.

It uses an enumeration to represent the various actions required by the game server,
such as initialization, naming, role assignment, and specific actions like talking,
voting, divine actions, and attacks. The class provides class methods to check if
the incoming request matches one of the predefined actions, allowing for streamlined
handling of the game's requests.
